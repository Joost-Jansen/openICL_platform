# ICL Platform

In this repository, we introduce a simple yet powerful application that extends the OpenICL framework with a visual interface. Thereby, we further enable the analysis and exploration of ICL techniques across various LLMs, tasks, and datasets. This platform provides researchers and practitioners with a flexible and user-friendly interface to experiment with different configurations and evaluate the effectiveness of different ICL strategies\.

This work is completed under the Natural Language Processing course by TU Delft.
